#### We'll cover a few categories of basic array manipulations here:
> - Attributes of arrays: Determining the size, shape, memory consumption, and data types of arrays
>- Indexing of arrays: Getting and setting the value of individual array elements
>- Slicing of arrays: Getting and setting smaller subarrays within a larger array
>- Reshaping of arrays: Changing the shape of a given array
>- Joining and splitting of arrays: Combining multiple arrays into one, and splitting one array into many

#### NumPy Array Attributes
Each array has attributes ``ndim`` (the number of dimensions), ``shape`` (the size of each dimension), and ``size`` (the total size of the array):
```python
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(0)  # seed for reproducibility

x1 = np.random.randint(10, size=6)  # One-dimensional array
x2 = np.random.randint(10, size=(3, 4))  # Two-dimensional array
x3 = np.random.randint(10, size=(3, 4, 5))  # Three-dimensional array

print("x3 ndim: ", x3.ndim)
print("x3 shape:", x3.shape)
print("x3 size: ", x3.size)

Out:x3 ndim:  3
x3 shape: (3, 4, 5)
x3 size:  60
```

Another useful attribute is the ``dtype``, the data type of the array (which we discussed previously in [Understanding Data Types in Python](02.01-Understanding-Data-Types.ipynb)):
```python
print("dtype:", x3.dtype)
Output:dtype: int64
```
### Array Indexing: Accessing Single Elements
If you are familiar with Python's standard list indexing, indexing in NumPy will feel quite familiar. In a one-dimensional array, the $i^{th}$ value (counting from zero) can be accessed by specifying the desired index in square brackets, just as with Python lists
```python
x2
Out:array([[3, 5, 2, 4],
       [7, 6, 8, 8],
       [1, 6, 7, 7]])
x2[0, 0]
Out:3
```
### Array Slicing: Accessing Subarrays
Just as we can use square brackets to access individual array elements, we can also use them to access subarrays with the *slice* notation, marked by the colon (``:``) character.
The NumPy slicing syntax follows that of the standard Python list; to access a slice of an array ``x``, use this:
``` python
x[start:stop:step]
```
If any of these are unspecified, they default to the values ``start=0``, ``stop=``*``size of dimension``*, ``step=1``.
We'll take a look at accessing sub-arrays in one dimension and in multiple dimensions.

#### One-dimensional subarrays
```python
x = np.arange(10)
x
Out:
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

x[:5]  # first five elements
Out:array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])

x[::2]  # every other element
Out:array([0, 2, 4, 6, 8])

x[1::2]  # every other element, starting at index 1
Out:array([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])
```

A potentially confusing case is when the ``step`` value is negative. In this case, the defaults for ``start`` and ``stop`` are swapped.This becomes a convenient way to reverse an array:

```python
x[::-1]  # all elements, reversed
Out:array([9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0])

x[5::-2]  # reversed every other from index 5
Out:array([5, 3, 1])
```

#### Multi-dimensional subarrays

Multi-dimensional slices work in the same way, with multiple slices separated by commas.For example:
```python
x2
Out:array([[12,  5,  2,  4],
       [ 7,  6,  8,  8],
       [ 1,  6,  7,  7]])

x2[:2, :3]  # two rows, three columns
Out:array([[12,  5,  2],
       [ 7,  6,  8]])

```

#### Accessing array rows and columns

One commonly needed routine is accessing of single rows or columns of an array.
This can be done by combining indexing and slicing, using an empty slice marked by a single colon (``:``):
```python
print(x2[:, 0])  # first column of x2
Out:[12  7  1]
print(x2[0, :])  # first row of x2
Out:[12  5  2  4]
```
In the case of row access, the empty slice can be omitted for a more compact syntax:
```pyhton
print(x2[0])  # equivalent to x2[0, :]
[12  5  2  4]
```

#### Subarrays as no-copy views

One important–and extremely useful–thing to know about array slices is that they return *views* rather than *copies* of the array data.This is one area in which NumPy array slicing differs from Python list slicing: in lists, slices will be copies.Consider our two-dimensional array from before:
```python
print(x2)
Out:[[12  5  2  4]
 [ 7  6  8  8]
 [ 1  6  7  7]]
```
Let's extract a  2×2  subarray from this:
```python
x2_sub = x2[:2, :2]
print(x2_sub)

Out:[[12  5]
 [ 7  6]]
```
Now if we modify this subarray, we'll see that the original array is changed! Observe:
```python
x2_sub[0, 0] = 99
print(x2_sub)
Out:[[99  5]
 [ 7  6]]
```

```python
print(x2)
Out:[[99  5  2  4]
 [ 7  6  8  8]
 [ 1  6  7  7]]
```
## Reshaping of Arrays

Another useful type of operation is reshaping of arrays.The most flexible way of doing this is with the ``reshape`` method.For example, if you want to put the numbers 1 through 9 in a $3 \times 3$ grid, you can do the following:
```python
grid = np.arange(1, 10).reshape((3, 3))
print(grid)
Out:[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]

```
### Concatenation of arrays

Concatenation, or joining of two arrays in NumPy, is primarily accomplished using the routines ``np.concatenate``, ``np.vstack``, and ``np.hstack``.``np.concatenate`` takes a tuple or list of arrays as its first argument, as we can see here:

```python
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
y = np.array([3, 2, 1])
np.concatenate([x, y])

Out:array([1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1])
```
For working with arrays of mixed dimensions, it can be clearer to use the ``np.vstack`` (vertical stack) and ``np.hstack`` (horizontal stack) functions:

```python
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
grid = np.array([[9, 8, 7],
                 [6, 5, 4]])

# vertically stack the arrays
np.vstack([x, grid])
Out:array([[1, 2, 3],
       [9, 8, 7],
       [6, 5, 4]])
```
```python
# horizontally stack the arrays
y = np.array([[99],
              [99]])
np.hstack([grid, y])
Out:array([[ 9,  8,  7, 99],
       [ 6,  5,  4, 99]])
```
### Splitting of arrays

The opposite of concatenation is splitting, which is implemented by the functions ``np.split``, ``np.hsplit``, and ``np.vsplit``.  For each of these, we can pass a list of indices giving the split points:
```python
x = [1, 2, 3, 99, 99, 3, 2, 1]
x1, x2, x3 = np.split(x, [3, 5])
print(x1, x2, x3)
Out:1 2 3] [99 99] [3 2 1]
```
